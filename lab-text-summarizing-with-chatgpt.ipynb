    "We only see one side of the Moon because it is tidally locked to the Earth. This means the Moon takes the same amount of time to rotate once on its axis as it does to complete one orbit around Earth—about 27.3 days. As a result, the same hemisphere of the Moon always faces Earth. This synchronization happened due to gravitational forces over millions of years. Early in the Moon's history, Earth's gravity created tidal bulges on the Moon, which caused friction and slowed its rotation until it matched its orbital period. Although the Moon does rotate, its rotation is perfectly timed with its orbit, so we always see the same face. However, due to a slight wobble in its orbit called libration, we can actually observe about 59% of the Moon’s surface over time—not just a flat 50%. The far side remains out of direct view from Earth.\n",

    "The paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" introduced the Transformer architecture, revolutionizing NLP and large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous models that relied on recurrence (RNNs) or convolution (CNNs), the Transformer uses self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences in parallel, making it more efficient and scalable. In LLMs, this allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, regardless of their position. The architecture has two main components: an encoder (for understanding input) and a decoder (for generating output). However, most LLMs like GPT use only the decoder for text generation. Key innovations include multi-head attention, positional encoding, and layer normalization, enabling deep models to capture complex language patterns. This architecture paved the way for models like GPT, BERT, and T5. The paper’s core idea—that attention alone can handle language tasks—became the foundation for state-of-the-art LLMs used in AI today.\n",
